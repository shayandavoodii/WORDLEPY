# ðŸ”®Motivation
I got familiar with [WORDLE](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) through social media a year ago. I used to play it for consecutive days. However, I was unsatisfied with it. The game had limitations in rounds of playing (still has), and it only permits the users to play it once a day. Sometimes I tried it in several browsers to bypass the limit until I found the answer. But that didn't satisfy me because I wanted to play more and guess different words. So I decided to have my own WORDLE game. This is the motivation behind this work, and today (after more than a year), I decided to make this repo public. Maybe one day, I will come up with a lot of code refactoring  or even suitable design material. I'm not an application developer, and in those moments, I just wanted to incorporate features that I wanted into the application and ignored the code's design and maintainability.

# ðŸ’»GUI Version

The application's functionality is pretty simple. Just run the latest version of the executable file, and you'll be faced with the following screen.
1. To start a game or a new turn, click the "Start" button.

2. Write a word with five letters in the text box and hit the "Enter" button or press the key shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> to see the result of your first guess.

You'll see the following screen after you hit Enter, and I've provided some details about each segment in the following snapshot:

Continue entering words until you find the chosen word. It's possible to monitor the winner's guess and success rate through the "Stats" button by pressing the key shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> and the history of playing the game by hitting the "History" button or pressing the key shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd>.

# REPL version
Make sure to put the `frequent_5_char_words.csv` file in the same directory that the code is in. Also, you need to install the following packages:    
1. numpy: `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
2. pandas: `conda install -c conda-forge pandas`
3. emoji: `conda install -c conda-forge emoji`  

You can make six guesses to infer the chosen word, a 5-letter meaningful English word.
1. Enter `exit` to quit. 
2. you can enter `?` to give up while you have guessed four wrong words
3. enter `cls` to clear output
